<h5> Why You GOTTA Change the Yes File in Your Linux Machine </h5>

if you're using Gnu/linux operating system, try to type yes on your terminal (press CTRL+C to stop it btw), the yes command is a file that comes with most linux distros and somehow it has some use cases, my problem with this file is that it takes a big place in your hard drive, I made this file which is called yes too, and so as to use it clone this repo in your machine, then be root, romeve the /bin/yes file then move the new yes file to that location
